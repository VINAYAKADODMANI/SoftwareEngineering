* model of SDLC
-- Waterfall model
    -- no overlapping of the phases
    -- the steps will continue one after the other
  -- good for samll project
-- V shape model
  -- process ececution happens ina sequential manner like v
  -- also called as varification and validation \
  --one side the varificatioon will happen and the oteeher side validation will take place
  -- the code part will be connected from both
  -- good for samll project
-- Evolutary model
  -- combination of iterative and incremental model
-- spiral model
  -- combi of iterative and sequential linear dev model
-- Prototying model
